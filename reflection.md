- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?

    *I find that it is fairly confusing for me to understand association because it seems like a natural way of coding, and I felt like it would be more difficult to grasp. Because of that, identifying what it looks like in code is not the easiest task for me.*

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    *I'm pretty sure that all of it works so far, but I had a difficult time formatting Train. I would give the advice to someone who is taking the course that they should learn how to make proper constructors.*
